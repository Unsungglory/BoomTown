Good Afternoon! 

Thank you for viewing my project! 

I was not able to finish in the timeframe however I am very proud of what I was able to learn in so short a time.

The Retrofit functions are functional and the app GETs all data from swapi.dev successfully however I was not able to quite figure out the adapter to dynamically load all buttons.

This was a wonderful little app. On the surface it does seem very simple, but it tests RESTFUL, intents, adapters, Kotlin, Android Studio, and just good ol' object oriented programming. Thank you for allowing me to do this. 

I will be finishing this project in my own time as I do see the value in obtaining this skills and moreover, I hope the skills I have obtained over the last little bit are enough to push to the next round! 

Thank you for your time,
Nicholas Martin
